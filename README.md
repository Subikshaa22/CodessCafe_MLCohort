# ML Cohort Assignments  

This repository contains the files for submission for the ML Cohort assignments.  

## Week 2  

I have created a notebook using **Google Colab** and explored the following machine learning models:  

### 1. Decision Tree  
- Used a **Decision Tree** model to predict whether a student will get selected for **MBA admission**.  
- The prediction is based on the following factors:  
  - **Major**  
  - **Age**  
  - **Race**  
  - **Gender**  
  - **GMAT Score**  
  - **Work Experience**  

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Implemented a **KNN model** to predict whether a client will **subscribe to a term deposit** or not.  
- The prediction is based on factors such as:  
  - **Age**  
  - **Job**  
  - **Marital Status**  
  - **Education**  
  - Other relevant features

### ðŸ“‚ Files  
- **Week_2_Notebook.ipynb** â†’ Contains the implementation of Decision Tree and KNN models.
- **Week_2_Datasets** â†’ Contains the two datasets used for the implementation

### ðŸ”— How to Run  
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.  
2. Run the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the models.
